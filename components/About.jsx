          As an IT professional with over{" "}
          <span className="text-purple-500">5.7 years of experience</span>, I
          work as a software developer. Currently, I am employed by Acclivis
          Technologies Pune, India. Along with my understanding of{" "}
          <span className="text-purple-500">React JS</span> and{" "}
          <span className="text-purple-500">Redux</span>, I have a little bit
          of knowledge of <span className="text-purple-500">NodeJS</span>. My
          goal is to upgrade my skill sets as an individual by pushing the
          boundaries. With confidence and friendliness, I am able to work well
          both independently and collaboratively. I am excited to learn about
          the latest technologies on the market. I have already developed a
          good knowledge of{" "}
          <span className="text-purple-500">Web 3.0 technologies</span>. The
          next step would be to gain more expertise in these technologies.
