### I AM

As an IT professional with over 5.7 years of experience, I work as a software developer. 
Along with my understanding of React JS and Redux, I have a little bit of knowledge of NodeJS.

My goal is to upgrade my skill sets as an individual by pushing the boundaries. With confidence and friendliness, I am able to work well both independently and collaboratively. 

I am excited to learn about the latest technologies on the market. I have already developed a good knowledge of Web 3.0 technologies. The next step would be to gain more expertise in these technologies.
